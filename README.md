### Steps to run

 1. Clone to your machine
 2. npm i (to install library)
 3. npm start (start server)
 4. Go to http://localhost:1221/

The location step, which has Google Maps, is just a mock up, I don't have Google key to run real map.

Some styling may not be done, it is tedious job, and I am bored now.
